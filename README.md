# Croquet Jasmine (2004)

![Screenshot of Welcome Project](screenshot.png)

Live version: [codefrau.github.io/jasmine](https://codefrau.github.io/jasmine/)

This is a version of Croquet Jasmine running on the [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org) virtual machine.
Here is an [early demo of the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXGLOiZUZ2U) from 2003.
Alan Kay used it for his [Turing Award lecture in 2004](https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Alan_Kay_Turing_Award_Lecture_(2004)) (jump to 1 hour in for the Croquet part, but the whole thing is worth a watch).
While working on that demo, David Smith posted some blog entries

This is work-in-progress. Contributions are very welcome.

## How to launch the Demos

By default, only the "SampleTeapot" morph is running, which only has a mirror in it (portals are a big part of Croquet, and a mirror is basically a portal into the same world).

Close that morph: You are in Squeak Smalltalk, everything onscreen is a Morph, and every morph has a "halo" you can bring up using the middle mouse button on a three-button mouse, or cmd-click (Mac) / alt-click (PCs). The top-left pink halo handle with an X will close. The other handles have mouse-over balloon help.

Drag out the full "Teapot" from the green objects tool. It will start downloading a lot of content. Please wait patiently until everything is loaded (the reading glasses cursor will disappear). At some point there will be a sound, then a blue status line will appear at the bottom of the 3D teapot morph. It's only truly finished when that statusline disappears again.

Save the image – that is a Smalltalk term for storing a snapshot of your whole current environment. By doing this, we won't have to wait as long the next time. Click on the gray background, which will pop up a "World" menu. I'd suggest using "Save as..." and give it a name different than "BridgeDemo.image" so you can easily go back to that one. When you reload your browser page, it will by default load the BridgeDeo image again. But you can load the image you saved by appending `?image=myimage.image` to the URL (assuming you named your image `myimage`).

Note that there are other interesting Teapot morphs in the objects tool you might want to explore.

## Things to do

### Move around

Use the right mouse button (or two-finger click on MacBooks) to move. This works like a joystick – the further from the screen center, the faster you move or turn.

### Icons

**Donut button (top-left):** brings up the morphic halo (useful when you're in full-screen)

**Camera button (top-right):** takes a snapshot to return to this position later

**Telephone button (right-center):** starts a call (not working yet)

### Dock

Move your mouse pointer towards the lower edge of the 3D window. Various items will slide in from the bottom:

**Projects:** These are various projects (a.k.a. desktops) you can jump to. Use the World menu's "previous project" or "jump to project..." entries to go back.

**Snaphots:** Here are "snapshots" of the different spaces you can jump to. Use the camera button to create your own, to easily get back to a certain view. When you hover your pointer longer over one of the spaces, it actually shows a live view of that space (you would only notice that if somehthing is movign inside, of course).

**Tools:**

* TPainter lets you paint a 3D object – press keep to turn it into a balloon-animal like shape. The "?" button at the top will show a library of previous paintings (a.k.a. sketches).
* TSpaceBrowser shows a hierarchical view of all TObjects in the space.
* TConnectionDialog used to allow collaboration via the network (not supported yet in this revival)

**Alice:** a library of 3D models from Randy Pausch's Alice project at CMU. Click one to import, then move backwards to see it. If there is an error, close the pink error window and try a different one.

### Popup Menu

Click somewhere that's not an object (ground, sky) and a popup window will be opened in the middle of the screen. It has various options (dependening on which kind of TeapotMorph is running).

In the lower left is the Bridge Demo that Alan was showing in his Turing award lecture. Press "w" (for "wind") and edit the variable on top to `true`, press Cmd-S to save. The wind will now affect the bridge. Other simulation scripts are "m" and "s" (masses and springs). Press "f" to release the bridge and turn it into a flag (with dramatic sound).

### TWindows

These hold additional spaces, in 3D or 2D. The blue window frame highlights in green when moving the mouse pointer over it. The window frame is active:

* top edge: move window left/right and up/down
* bottom edge: move window left/right and forwards/backwards
* left/right edge: rotate window (release while moving to make it spin)
* corners: resize

Hovering reveals a few buttons floating above:

* X: close
* Camera: create a snapshot
* Arrow: jump in front of that window so that it fills your whole view (useful for 2D windows in particular)
* Hand: grab a window – it will stay with you when you move (even when moving through a portal to a different space). Click the hand again to release
* Plus/Minus: show/hide the contents of that window

## Spaces

In the far back of this space are two 2D windows, one with the "drive a car" tutorial, the other showing a chess game.

In the front there are 6 windows, each showing one of the people working on Croquet in various capacities. From left to right:

### Mars

(Photo: [Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_P._McCahill))
Click the rover to mount/unmount, or use the f/b keys so change the forwards/backwards speed, and l/r keys to change the left/right steering.

### 3 body simulation (Earth, Moon, 3rd)

(Photo: [David Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_P._Reed))
Press 1/2/3/-/+ to make the third body move at different speeds, and observe its blue trajectory path. Press space to reset.

### Underwater

(Photo: [Andreas Raab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Raab))
This is a world with tutorials on how to make your own fish and make it swim.

### Waves

(Photo: [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay))
Click and drag inside the window to create waves.

### Aqueduct

## Hack

This is a full [Squeak](https://squeak.org) Smalltalk environment. All the tools to modify it are included – like a system browser, senders/implementers tools etc. Feel free to experiment!

It's running on [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org), a Smalltalk virtual machine written in JavaScript. The original virtual machine was a 32 bit executable that on many modern achines does not work anymore.

It uses plugins for various tasks, and I (Vanessa) had to write a few new ones to support Croquet Jasmine. In particular, these are the [Balloon3D Accelerator Plugin](jasmine-b3daccel-plugin.js), [Balloon3D Engine Plugin](jasmine-b3dengine-plugin.js),
[MPEG3Plugin](jasmine-mpeg3-plugin.js), and [OpenGL](jasmine-opengl.js).
The latter is not a "regular" plugin providing Smalltalk primitives, but provides the equivalent of an OpenGL library with functions that are called via FFI. For efficiency, it emulates the OpenGL 1.x state but uses WebGL for the actual rendering.

If we get these complete, they should be upstreamed to SqueakJS. For the moment I only implemented the parts that are needed to get Croquet working.

One big thing I have not gotten to completely work yet is collaboration – the original Croquet was fully collaborative. I started implementing a SocketPlugin that emulates a full TCP/IP stack on top of  [modern Croquet](https://croquet.io) as transport, meaning it emulates an IP network. The existing SqueakJS SocketPlugin only allows http/https connections. The tests appear to work, but not the Croquet multiuser mode. Help would be very much appreciated.
